Problem & Solution
-------------

While you are creating a web site to for restaurant, while users visit to the restaurant, you wish to getting the feedback of the restaurant. You offered. How did you measure. Using existing 5 star rating system is enough?


We come with a solution that we are enabling the feedback through our small chunk of JSON API **feed_resturnat.json**

```javascript
{
  "product" : "resturant",
  "features" : [
    {
      "feature_name" : "clean",
      "weight" : "1",
      "locality" : [ "all" ]
    },
    {
      "feature_name" : "humanity",
      "weight" : "1",
      "locality" : [ "all" ]
    },
    {
      "feature_name" : "on-time-serving",
      "weight" : "1",
      "locality" : [ "all" ]
    },
    {
      "feature_name" : "healthy-food",
      "weight" : "1",
      "locality" : [ "all" ]
    },
    {
      "feature_name" : "spicy",
      "weight" : "1",
      "locality" : [ "lk" ]
    },
    {
      "feature_name" : "richness",
      "weight" : "1",
      "locality" : [ "all" ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Like this we can create each and categorised based feedback templates to the world.
